Hi, my name is Sari Greenblatt, a full stack developer.
This project is an application for managing a list of employees, written using .NET and react languages.
To run the application, enter the cmd window in the employees folder and type npm i in order to use the project's installations, after the operation is finished, open visual studio code, run it (of course also the server side, the database) and enjoy!!!
In order to view the list of employees and perform the necessary actions on them,
On the login page, type in each of the typing boxes (first name, last name and password)
the word "admin".
Successfully!!!
